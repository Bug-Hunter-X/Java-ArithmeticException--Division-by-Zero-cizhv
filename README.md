This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in Java programming: the ArithmeticException resulting from division by zero. The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file contains the buggy code, which directly attempts division by zero. The `UncommonErrorExampleSolution.java` file provides a solution demonstrating how to handle this exception using a try-catch block to prevent program termination.  This simple example highlights how seemingly straightforward calculations can lead to unexpected runtime errors.
